Add the card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-label-font-size: "18px"      # Axis labels, date/hour/rain labels
  meteogram-legend-font-size: "16px"     # Legend text
  meteogram-tick-font-size: "15px"       # Y axis tick text
entity_id: weather.home
# Optional: toggle display components
show_cloud_cover: true
show_pressure: true
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-rain-bar-color: "#2196f3"
  meteogram-rain-max-bar-color: "#90caf9"
  meteogram-temp-line-color: "#ff9800"
  meteogram-pressure-line-color: "#1976d2"
  meteogram-wind-barb-color: "#388e3c"
  meteogram-rain-label-color: "#d32f2f"
  meteogram-rain-max-label-color: "#1976d2"
  meteogram-cloud-color: red
```

**Important Note:**  
Most Home Assistant weather integrations do **not** provide the full set of attributes that meteogram-card can display.  
For example, some integrations may lack cloud cover, `precipitation_max`, or even wind speed and direction.  
- All values must be strings.
- You can override any CSS variable used by the card.
- For dark mode, use the `modes: dark:` section in your theme YAML (see below).
- For a full list of variables, see [doc/STYLES.md](doc/STYLES.md).
**Caching:**  
Forecasts are cached in localStorage under `meteogram-card-entity-weather-cache`, keyed by entity ID.  
Multiple entities can be cached and retrieved independently.

### Option Notes
**Breaking change:** `show_precipitation` is now the only supported option for precipitation display. The legacy `show_rain` option has been removed and is no longer supported. Update your configuration to use `show_precipitation` only.
- `meteogram_hours` replaces the deprecated `meteogram_length` option. For backward compatibility, `meteogram_length` is still supported but will be ignored if `meteogram_hours` is set.
- `layout_mode` controls the card's layout. Possible values:
  - `sections` (default): Standard Home Assistant card layout.
  - `panel`: Wide, single-panel layout (good for dashboards).
  - `grid`: Grid layout for advanced dashboarding.
- `aspect_ratio` only applies in `panel` or `grid` layout modes.
- `diagnostics` enables a status panel for troubleshooting API/data issues.
- `display_mode` is the preferred way to set the card's display style. Use `"focussed"` for a minimal chart-only view.
- `altitude` is optional and can be set to improve forecast accuracy for locations at significant elevation. If not set, the Home Assistant default altitude is used (if available).

### Layout Mode (`layout_mode`)

> **Experimental Option for Advanced/Legacy Views**

The `layout_mode` option controls the overall layout of the meteogram card. The default and recommended value is `sections`, which is designed to integrate seamlessly with Home Assistant's modern dashboard experience.

- **sections** (default, recommended):
  - The primary and best-supported view for meteogram-card.
  - Uses Home Assistant's standard card layout, ensuring maximum compatibility and visual consistency.
  - All features and options are tested and optimized for this mode.
- **panel** (experimental):
  - Renders the chart in a wide, single-panel layout.
  - Useful for legacy dashboards or custom kiosk views.
  - Some features or styling may not be as robust as in `sections` mode.
- **grid** (experimental):
  - Places the chart in a grid layout for advanced dashboarding.
  - Intended for power users and special use cases.
  - May not be fully supported in all Home Assistant themes or dashboard types.

> **Note:** The `panel` and `grid` modes are provided for advanced users and legacy compatibility. Most users should use the default `sections` mode for the best experience.

> **Note:** The `layout_mode` option is **not available in the visual (interactive) editor**. To use `layout_mode`, you must open the YAML editor (click "Show code editor" in the card configuration dialog) and add the option manually. This is because `layout_mode` is an advanced/experimental feature and not exposed in the standard UI.

### Aspect Ratio (`aspect_ratio`)

> **Only applies in `panel` or `grid` layout modes**

The `aspect_ratio` option allows you to control the width-to-height ratio of the chart area. This is only relevant if you are using `layout_mode: panel` or `layout_mode: grid`.

- Examples: `16:9` (default), `4:3`, `1:1`, `21:9`, `3:2`, or a custom value like `1.6` or `5:3`.
- Has no effect in the default `sections` layout mode.

**Recommended:**
- Use the default `sections` layout for most dashboards. Only use `panel` or `grid` (and thus `aspect_ratio`) if you have a specific advanced use case or are maintaining a legacy dashboard.


### Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
title: Weather Forecast
latitude: 51.5074
longitude: -0.1278
entity_id: weather.home
show_cloud_cover: true
show_pressure: true
show_precipitation: true
show_weather_icons: true
show_wind: true
dense_weather_icons: true
meteogram_hours: 48h
aspect_ratio: "16:9"
layout_mode: sections
diagnostics: false
display_mode: full
styles:
  meteogram-label-font-size: "16px"
  meteogram-grid-color: "#1976d2"
```

#### Example: Focussed Mode (Minimal Chart)
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
display_mode: focussed
```

#### Example: Panel Layout with Custom Aspect Ratio
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
layout_mode: panel
aspect_ratio: "21:9"
```

#### Example: Diagnostics Panel Enabled
 
For more details and examples, see [doc/STYLES.md](doc/STYLES.md).
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
diagnostics: true
The card provides built-in defaults for all CSS variables for both light and dark mode. You can override these in your Home Assistant theme or via the `styles` property. For dark mode, use the `modes: dark:` section in your theme YAML.
```

## Note on Color Codes in Documentation

> **Why are some colors named instead of hex codes?**
> To avoid HACS/GitHub auto-linking hex codes like `#333` and `#444` as issue references, these have been replaced with named CSS colors (e.g., `darkgray`, `dimgray`, `gray`, `black`) in documentation examples. You can safely copy-paste these values—they will work in Home Assistant and CSS. Other hex codes remain unchanged.

**Example: Customize chart colors**
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-cloud-color: "#ffb300"
  meteogram-grid-color: "#1976d2"
```

**Example: Change font size for labels, legends, and axis ticks**
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-label-font-size: "18px"      # Axis labels, date/hour/rain labels
  meteogram-legend-font-size: "16px"     # Legend text
  meteogram-tick-font-size: "15px"       # Y axis tick text
```

**Example: Customize rain bar, temperature line, pressure line, wind barb colors, and rain label text**
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-rain-bar-color: "#2196f3"
  meteogram-rain-max-bar-color: "#90caf9"
  meteogram-temp-line-color: "#ff9800"
  meteogram-pressure-line-color: "#1976d2"
  meteogram-wind-barb-color: "#388e3c"
  meteogram-rain-label-color: "#d32f2f"
  meteogram-rain-max-label-color: "#1976d2"
  meteogram-cloud-color: red
```


**Usage notes:**
- All values must be strings.
- You can override any CSS variable used by the card.
- For dark mode, you can customize variables directly in your card config using a `modes: dark:` section inside `styles:`. This works just like in Home Assistant themes.
- For a full list of variables, see [doc/STYLES.md](doc/STYLES.md).

**Example: Customizing dark mode in your card config**
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  meteogram-grid-color: "#1976d2"
  meteogram-cloud-color: "#ffb300"
  modes:
    dark:
      meteogram-grid-color: "#444444"
      meteogram-cloud-color: "darkgray"
```
This will apply the dark mode colors only when Home Assistant is in dark mode, for this card instance.


#### List of Customizable CSS Variables

You can override the following CSS variables via the `styles` option or your theme YAML (without the `--` prefix):

- `meteogram-label-font-size`
- `meteogram-legend-font-size`
- `meteogram-tick-font-size`
- `meteogram-cloud-color`
- `meteogram-grid-color`
- `meteogram-pressure-line-color`
- `meteogram-timescale-color`
- `meteogram-rain-bar-color`
- `meteogram-rain-max-bar-color`
- `meteogram-temp-line-color`
- `meteogram-wind-barb-color`
- `meteogram-rain-label-color`
- `meteogram-rain-max-label-color`
- `meteogram-snow-bar-color`
- ...and more (see [doc/STYLES.md](doc/STYLES.md) for the full list)

For more details and examples, see [doc/STYLES.md][styledoc-url].

## Weather Data

This card fetches weather data from the Met.no API or from a Home Assistant weather entity.  
If no coordinates or entity are specified, it will use your Home Assistant's configured location.

The card uses the "complete" API endpoint to retrieve precipitation probability data, which allows visualization of rain/snow uncertainty.

## Development

For developers, the Meteogram Card is built with TypeScript and uses modern web technologies.

| styles               | {{}}         |
| diagnostics          | DIAGNOSTICS_DEFAULT |
| entityId             | undefined    |
| focussed             | false        |

*Note: `DIAGNOSTICS_DEFAULT` is defined in the code and typically defaults to `false` for production builds.*


## CSS Variable Defaults

The following are the default CSS variables for the card. You can override these in your Home Assistant theme or via the `styles` property:

```css
:host {
  --meteogram-grid-color: #b8c4d9;
  --meteogram-temp-line-color: orange;
  --meteogram-pressure-line-color: #90caf9;
  --meteogram-rain-bar-color: deepskyblue;
  --meteogram-rain-max-bar-color: #7fdbff;
  --meteogram-rain-label-color: #0058a3;
  --meteogram-rain-max-label-color: #2693e6;
  --meteogram-cloud-color: #b0bec5;
  --meteogram-wind-barb-color: #1976d2;
  --meteogram-snow-bar-color: #b3e6ff;
  --meteogram-label-font-size: 13px;
  --meteogram-legend-font-size: 14px;
  --meteogram-tick-font-size: 13px;
  --meteogram-axis-label-color: #000;
  --meteogram-timescale-color: #ffb300;
}
```

*Note: The card no longer uses `-dark` variable names. Instead, all variables are automatically applied for the correct mode using Home Assistant's theme system and the `:host([dark])` selector.*

### Wind Barbs

The meteogram displays wind speed, direction, and gusts using professional-style wind barbs, a standard meteorological symbol. Each wind barb is plotted at the corresponding forecast hour and visually encodes the wind speed, direction, and gust information:

- **Direction:**
  - The shaft of the wind barb points in the direction **from which** the wind is blowing.
  - **North is up** on the chart, so a barb pointing straight up means wind is coming from the north (blowing south).
  - For example, a barb pointing to the right (east) means wind is coming from the east (blowing west).
- **Sustained Wind Speed (Right Side):**
  - Wind speed is indicated by the number and type of barbs (feathers) and pennants on the **right side** of the shaft:
    - **Short feather:** 5 knots
    - **Long feather:** 10 knots
    - **Pennant (triangle):** 50 knots
  - The total wind speed is the sum of the values of all feathers and pennants on the barb.
  - For example, a barb with one pennant, one long feather, and one short feather represents 65 knots (50 + 10 + 5).
  - If the wind is very light (less than 2 knots), a small circle is drawn instead of a barb ("calm").
- **Wind Gusts (Left Side):**
  - **Wind gusts are displayed on the left side** of the wind barb shaft in **orange color**.
  - Gust feathers and pennants follow the same convention as sustained wind (5kt, 10kt, 50kt).
  - Gust visualization shows the **absolute gust speed**, not the difference from sustained wind.
  - Only displayed when gust data is available from the weather source.
- **Placement:**
  - Wind barbs are shown in a dedicated band below the main chart area, aligned with the forecast hour.
  - The length of the shaft and the size of the feathers are scaled for readability.

**Reading the wind barbs:**
- The orientation of the shaft shows the wind's origin direction (where it's coming from).
- **Right side feathers/pennants** show sustained wind speed in knots (blue/black color).
- **Left side feathers/pennants** show wind gust speed in knots (orange color).
- Calm winds (less than 2 knots) are shown as a small circle.

**Examples:**
- A wind barb pointing up with one long and one short feather on the right: wind from the north at 15 knots sustained.
- A wind barb pointing left with two long feathers on the right and one pennant on the left: wind from the west at 20 knots sustained, 50 knots gusts.
- A wind barb with one pennant and one long feather on the right, plus one pennant and one short feather on the left (orange): 60 knots sustained, 55 knots gusts.

This visualization allows you to quickly assess both the strength and direction of the wind at each forecast hour, just as in professional meteorological charts.
