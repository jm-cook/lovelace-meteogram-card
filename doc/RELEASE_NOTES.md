## v2.0.0 ‚Äì Introducing Fully Themeable Chart with Light & Dark Mode Support

Meteogram Card v2.0.0 brings a major upgrade: every chart element is now fully themeable using CSS variables, with dedicated support for both light and dark mode.  
Customize colors for temperature, pressure, rain, snow, wind barbs, gridlines, axis labels, timescale, and more‚Äîdirectly from your Home Assistant theme or card config.

**Highlights:**
- All chart elements use CSS variables for color and style.
- Each variable has a dark mode counterpart (e.g. `--meteogram-temp-line-color-dark`).
- Snow bars are now themeable (`--meteogram-snow-bar-color`, `--meteogram-snow-bar-color-dark`).
- No more repeated fallback colors‚Äîeverything is centralized and easy to override.
- See [STYLES.md](STYLES.md) for the full list of variables.

**Example: Customizing the chart for light and dark mode**
```yaml
type: custom:meteogram-card
styles:
  --meteogram-temp-line-color: "#ff9800"
  --meteogram-temp-line-color-dark: "#ffd54f"
  --meteogram-pressure-line-color: "#1976d2"
  --meteogram-pressure-line-color-dark: "#90caf9"
  --meteogram-rain-bar-color: "#2196f3"
