# Changelog

All notable changes to the Meteogram Card will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2026.8.2-beta] - 2026.08.18

### Added
- **Sunrise/sunset strip**: a day/night band above the chart, amber for daylight and blue-grey for night, with a marker at each sunrise and sunset and a tick at local midnight. Hover any segment for its times. Enabled with `show_sun` (on by default) and available in the visual editor.
  - Sun times are computed from the card's coordinates, so they are correct for the whole forecast rather than just today, and polar day and night are handled properly.
  - Tooltips follow Home Assistant's language and its 12/24-hour setting, and are translated into all supported languages.
- **Weather icons are now bundled with the card** rather than fetched from GitHub on every render. The card no longer needs network access for icons, works offline, and cannot be affected by rate limiting.

### Fixed
- Widening `meteogram_hours` did nothing — the forecast cache was being truncated in place, so the extra hours were no longer available to show.
- Switching `display_mode` did not redraw the chart, so `core` could keep showing `full`'s legends, and after `focussed` the legends never came back.
- Weather icons could silently disappear when GitHub rate-limited the request, and the card then retried twice per icon, making it worse.
- Home Assistant's 12/24-hour preference was ignored; times followed the language alone.
- A card title could be set but never cleared.
- The diagnostics panel appeared for everyone on a beta build instead of only when asked for.
- Day/night weather icons were chosen from the sun's position *at page load*, so every hour beyond today could be wrong.

### Changed
- `dist/` is no longer committed; releases are built by CI and attached as a release asset.

## [2026.1.2] - 2026.06.19

> **Note on the version number.** This release was cut in June and should have been
> `2026.6.2`. Because `2026.1.2` sorts below the May and June releases, update ordering
> was misleading for anyone who installed it. The tag is left in place so existing
> installations are not disturbed; later releases sort correctly above it.

### Added
- Danish translations
- Minor additions to the card

## [2026.6.1] - 2026.06.16

### Added
- Swedish translations

## [2026.5.1] - 2026.05.27

> Versioning moved from `3.x` semantic versions to calendar versions (`YYYY.M.patch`)
> with this release.

### Changed
- Chart rendering rebuilt on D3.js

## [3.2.7] - 2026.04.24

### Added
- Ukrainian translations

## [3.2.6] - 2026.03.02

### Fixed
- **Time axis labels now display correctly for all data resolutions**: Fixed issue where time labels disappeared completely when forecast data contains only hourly intervals (no 6-hourly data)
  - Added robust fallback logic that establishes time label patterns from any available data resolution
  - Supports weather services with varying intervals: 1h, 6h, 12h, 24h, or any combination
  - Tries progressive intervals (2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 12h) to find optimal label spacing
  - Always ensures at least some time labels are displayed, even with unusual data patterns
  - For long forecasts (240+ hours), automatically selects appropriate label intervals to prevent overlap
  - Low-resolution section now uses consistent data point intervals (every 2nd or 4th point) rather than hour-of-day filtering, ensuring uniform spacing across entire forecast
  - Prevents overlapping labels at the transition between high-resolution and low-resolution data sections
  - Hour labels now display with leading zeros (e.g., "01", "09") for better readability and consistent label width

## [3.2.5] - 2026.02.28

### Added
- **Custom hours display**: The `meteogram_hours` configuration option now accepts arbitrary numeric values (e.g., `120` for 120 hours) in addition to the previous string format (e.g., `"48h"`)
- Enhanced editor UI with dropdown presets (8h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, max) and a custom hours input option for any value
- Full backward compatibility with existing configurations using string format (`"8h"`, `"48h"`, etc.)
- Time-based calculation for mixed-resolution data: the parser now correctly calculates data points based on actual hours of coverage rather than data point count

### Fixed
- **Meteogram hours calculation with mixed-resolution data**: Fixed issue where numeric `meteogram_hours` values (e.g., `90`) were treated as data point counts instead of hours, causing incorrect behavior when forecast data transitions from hourly to 6-hourly intervals
  - The parser now walks the time array to calculate how many data points are needed to cover the requested hours
  - Properly handles mixed-resolution data (e.g., 90 hours correctly shows ~59 data points instead of capping at 88)
  - Always includes the complete timeslot containing the target end time (ceil behavior)
- **Improved label spacing for longer time ranges**: Fixed overlapping time labels along the bottom axis and rain labels, particularly noticeable in locales with longer time strings (e.g., German "14 Uhr")
  - Time labels now use `.getHours()` method directly for locale-independent hour values (always 0-23, no formatting issues)
  - Implemented dynamic label spacing based on measured text width instead of fixed intervals
  - Rain labels are now intelligently filtered to prevent overlap, prioritizing higher precipitation values
  - All label spacing adapts automatically to available space
- **Wind barbs now display correctly across entire forecast period**: Fixed issue where wind barbs disappeared after 48 hours when forecast data transitions from hourly to 6-hourly intervals
- Wind availability check now correctly validates both wind speed and wind direction data (previously only checked wind speed)
- Wind barb rendering now adapts to mixed-resolution data: uses 2-hour intervals for hourly data and 12-hour intervals for 6-hourly data
- Wind barb spacing is now timezone-agnostic and based on data index offsets rather than absolute time values

### Changed
- **Improved resilience during API outages**: When the Met.no API is temporarily unavailable, the card now continues to display the last cached forecast data instead of showing a full-screen error message
- The card leverages existing localStorage cache to maintain functionality during temporary API failures
- Error messages during API failures are now shown in the info tooltip (ℹ️) instead of covering the entire card
- The info icon changes to an alert icon (⚠️) with red color when displaying cached data due to an API error
- The tooltip displays a clear warning box when showing cached data, indicating the API is unavailable but the forecast is still visible

### Technical Details
- Enhanced error handling in `fetchWeatherData()` to return cached data from localStorage when API calls fail
- Modified render logic to only show full error display when no cached data is available
- Improved user experience during temporary network issues or Met.no API maintenance windows
- Wind barb rendering now detects data resolution transition points and adjusts visualization strategy accordingly

## [3.2.4] - 2026.02.14

### Added
- Czech translation

## [3.2.3] - 2026.02.14

### Added
- Dutch (NL) translation
- Polish (PL) translation

## [3.2.2] - 2026.01.08

### Fixed
- Temperature gradient wasn't transitioning through freezing point correctly

## [3.2.1] - 2025.12.04

### Fixed
- Temperature gradient wasn't transitioning through freezing point correctly

## [3.2.0] - 2025.11.24

### Added
- **Temperature Gradient Line**: The temperature line now features a color gradient that transitions from blue (cold/below freezing) to red/orange (warm/above freezing)
  - The gradient automatically calculates the freezing point position based on your temperature range
  - Fully backwards compatible: If you have set a custom `--meteogram-temp-line-color` CSS variable, your custom color will be used instead of the gradient
  - The gradient provides better visual differentiation of temperature ranges at a glance

### Notes
- No breaking changes in this release
- The temperature gradient is enabled by default. To use a solid color instead, set the `--meteogram-temp-line-color` CSS variable in your theme or card styles

## [3.1.3] - 2025.10.11

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `styles:` config for the card now uses variable names without the `--` prefix (e.g., `meteogram-grid-color` instead of `--meteogram-grid-color`)
- You can now also specify dark mode overrides directly in your card config using a `modes: dark:` section inside `styles:` (just like in Home Assistant themes)
- The old `-dark` variable names are no longer supported in the config
- Much of the code is reorganized to facilitate easier extension and addition of new features later
- Improvements have been made to updating so that if you are running an "always on" wall panel, the meteogram will update and hopefully not continue to show you stale data

## [3.0.3] - 2025.09.25

### Fixed
- **Wind Barb Direction Correction**: Wind barbs now correctly point in the direction the wind is blowing from (meteorological standard), rather than the direction the wind is blowing to
  - This change aligns with standard meteorological conventions and improves the accuracy of wind representation in the chart
  - For example, a wind barb pointing to the right indicates wind coming from the east (i.e., an easterly wind)
  - This change only affects the visual representation; the underlying wind direction data remains unchanged

## [3.0.2] - 2025.09.19

### Added
- **Optional Altitude for Met.no API**: You can now specify an `altitude` parameter in the card configuration. This is passed to the Met.no API for more accurate weather forecasts, especially in mountainous regions

### Changed
- **Improved Scaling for Legacy Dashboards (Experimental)**: The card now scales and sizes more reliably on dashboards that do not use Home Assistant's new sections layout
  - Note: This improved scaling is experimental and is not likely to be further developed or improved in the future

## [3.0.1] - 2025.09.15

### Added
- **New Display Mode Feature**: The card now supports three display modes: `full` (all features and legends), `core` (minimal, no legend), and `minimal` (ultra-minimal, no title or attribution)
  - Select your preferred mode with the `display_mode` config option
  - The legacy `focussed` option is now fully replaced by `display_mode`
  - Migration from old configs is automatic—if you previously used `focussed: true`, it will be converted to `display_mode: minimal`

### Fixed
- **Fahrenheit Double Conversion Bug**: Fixed an issue where weather entities using Fahrenheit as the main unit would sometimes display temperatures incorrectly due to double conversion
- **iOS API Connectivity**: Previous issues retrieving data from the Met.no API on iOS devices now appear to be resolved

### Changed
- **Sizing Improvements for Section View**: Chart sizing and layout have been improved for Home Assistant's section view, ensuring better fit and appearance in dashboards

## [3.0.0] - 2025.09.12

### Added
- **Weather Entity Support**: You can now use any Home Assistant weather entity as the data source for the meteogram
  - Set `entity_id` in your card config
  - See README.md for details and limitations
- **Entity Caching**: Forecasts from weather entities are cached in localStorage keyed by entity ID
  - Multiple entities can be cached and retrieved independently
- **Focus Mode**: New `focussed` option for a minimal chart display
  - When enabled, the card hides the title and attribution, showing only the chart—ideal for dashboards and kiosk views

### Changed
- **Met.no API remains supported**: If no `entity_id` is specified, the card uses the Met.no API as before
- **Automatic sizing**: The card now automatically sizes to its container (no more fillContainer option)
- **Chart Sizing & Margin Fixes**: The chart now fills the card correctly in all configurations, especially when pressure is not shown
- **Responsive Rendering**: Improved logic for chart width and margins ensures the meteogram adapts smoothly to all container sizes and modes

### Fixed
- Fixed chart layout issues when pressure is not displayed
- Improved handling of edge cases for chart rendering and data availability

## [2.1.0] - 2025.08.26

### Added
- **Multi-Language Support**: The card now automatically adapts labels, tooltips, and chart text to your Home Assistant language setting
  - Supported languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Norwegian, and Italian

### Changed
- **API Migration**: All weather data is now fetched from the Met.no API subdomain dedicated to Home Assistant, ensuring continued service and compliance with Met.no requirements
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced diagnostics for API errors, including localized error messages

### Notes
- Some iOS users report intermittent issues retrieving data from the Met.no API. This appears to be related to iOS network or browser restrictions and is outside the control of the card

## [2.0.0] - 2025.08.19

### Added
- **Fully Themeable Chart with Light & Dark Mode Support**: Every chart element is now fully themeable using CSS variables, with dedicated support for both light and dark mode
  - All chart elements use CSS variables for color and style
  - Each variable has a dark mode counterpart (e.g. `--meteogram-temp-line-color-dark`)
  - Snow bars are now themeable (`--meteogram-snow-bar-color`, `--meteogram-snow-bar-color-dark`)
  - No more repeated fallback colors—everything is centralized and easy to override
  - See STYLES.md for the full list of variables

### Notes
- Some defaults for colours or fonts may have changed in this release and the appearance may be slightly different from previous versions

## [1.0.9] - 2025.08.18

### Added
- **Temperature Unit Respect**: The card now uses the system temperature unit from Home Assistant (`°C` or `°F`) for all temperature displays
  - Temperatures are converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit as needed
- **API Success Indicator**: The API success flag now has three states:
  - Not Called / Cached: Green X (❎) with tooltip "cached"
  - Success: Green tick (✅) with tooltip "success"
  - Failed: Red X (❌) with tooltip "failed"
- **API Success Icon in Attribution**: The API success icon (with tooltip) is now shown next to the met.no attribution at the top right of the card
- Tooltips added to all API success indicators for clarity

### Changed
- **Dark Mode Improvements**: The card now better adapts to Home Assistant's dark mode, ensuring good contrast and readability

### Fixed
- Minor improvements to chart rendering and error handling
- Fixed bug in cloud cover shading where it would not display correctly

## [1.0.8] - 2025.08.18

### Added
- Added custom CSS variables for all chart elements improved theming and customization

### Fixed
- Ensured all grid lines consistently use the correct color variable in dark mode
